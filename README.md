OnlineStaff
===========

A simple and light weight Bukkit plugin that will allow server owners to query a database associated with OnlineStaff in order to get data on whether a staff member is online.

Commands and Permissions
------------------------

There is only one command currently that will allow reloading of the configuration file to edit changes to the database connection.

**Command**: /osreload


**Permission**: onlinestaff.reload


**Description**: Reload OnlineStaff's configuration file.

Web Usage
---------

I've taken the liberty to create and include a premade PHP script that will show as an example of how you may use this plugin on the web end. Of course it's just barebones and no styling, however
with just the example I gave users should be able to figure out how to do so much more with the information. I myself plan on showing my own version for my community on RPvP soon enough.

The script can be found above as "onlinestaff.php"

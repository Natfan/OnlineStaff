OnlineStaff
===========

A simple and light weight Bukkit plugin that will allow server owners to query a database associated with OnlineStaff in order to get data on whether a staff member is online.

Commands and Permissions
------------------------

There is only one command currently that will allow reloading of the configuration file to edit changes to the database connection.

**Command**: /osreload


**Permission**: onlinestaff.reload


**Description**: Reload OnlineStaff's configuration file.


**Permission node for staff groups / players**

**Permission**: onlinestaff.staff

Web Usage
---------

I've taken the liberty to create and include a premade PHP script that will show as an example of how you may use this plugin on the web end. Of course it's just barebones and no styling, however
with just the example I gave users should be able to figure out how to do so much more with the information. I myself plan on showing my own version for my community on RPvP soon enough.

The script can be found above as "onlinestaff.php"

Once you open it up, the only thing that you'll need to change (if you plan on just keeping it a list) is just the mysql connection credentials. Do as you please with this script, however I'd appreciate
if a little credit was directed back to my community (http://realmsofpvp.net).

Developer Notes
---------------
Other than that, have fun and I hope this plugin gives you an easy time to work with and the functionality of this plugin will provide you with much more!
